# Restaurant Profitability & Budget Optimization – Spag-Get-Tea

## Overview
This project presents a hands-on financial and operational analysis performed for a restaurant business simulation, *Spag-Get-Tea*. The aim was to evaluate the financial impact of operational decisions, optimize pricing strategies, forecast profits, and develop a robust budget plan using Excel and business logic.

## Objective
The core goal was to recommend actionable strategies to improve weekly profits by analyzing:
- Weekly revenue trends
- Menu pricing and cost of ingredients
- Customer behavior across multiple scenarios
- The financial impact of marketing efforts and timing changes

The project incorporated real-world business challenges where I performed budgeting, sales forecasting, COGS calculation, and scenario modeling to drive data-backed recommendations.

## Key Contributions
- **Budget Planning & Forecasting:** Calculated weekly income statements by estimating raw material costs, labor charges, and fixed expenses. Built models to simulate different operational strategies and predict their financial impact.
- **Profit Margin Analysis:** Determined the most and least profitable menu items by calculating profit margins at both item and weekly levels.
- **Discount Strategy Evaluation:** Analyzed the feasibility of a 25% promotional discount on select items, ensuring profitability sustainability.
- **Impact of Operational Adjustments:** Modeled and assessed the effect of extended lunch hours and discontinued marketing efforts on sales and customer retention.
- **Data-Driven Menu Optimization:** Identified high-performing menu items for continued promotion and low-margin items for review or substitution.
- **Scenario Modeling:** Created multiple “what-if” scenarios to test combinations of advertising, pricing, and operational hours to forecast maximum weekly profitability.

## Insights & Outcomes
- **Advertising Impact:** Discontinuing social media marketing reduced foot traffic and revenue, demonstrating the strong correlation between digital outreach and profitability.
- **Menu Insights:** *Cottage Pie* consistently yielded the highest margin, validating its potential as a signature item.
- **Optimized Promotions:** Despite offering a discount, *Bacon Butty* remained profitable due to its low COGS and high demand—making it ideal for weekly specials.
- **Operational Timing:** Extending lunch hours negatively affected revenue due to reduced demand during extended hours.

## Relevance to My Career Path
This project significantly enhanced my financial reasoning, budgeting acumen, and Excel modeling skills. It mirrors real-world business problems I may encounter in roles such as:
- **Financial Analyst** – For budgeting, forecasting, and profitability modeling.
- **Business Analyst** – For aligning business objectives with financial feasibility.
- **Data Analyst** – For interpreting transactional data and delivering actionable insights.

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to link raw data with business strategy, driving decisions that balance profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
